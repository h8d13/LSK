The installs themselves are pretty straight forward depending on distro

## After initial install

```sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y```

> **_NOTE:_**  While there might be many distros a lot of the kernel uses are similar so I'll try to not be too specific. 
> What is generic is to check your device for what components they have: Especially Graphics devices which often can cause issues. 
> The above can take a few minutes giving you time to do some Google work.

```lspci -nnk ``` 
To see all devices being detected including network, other devices, etc

```lspci | grep -i vga```
For GPU specifically

The same can be done with ```lsusb``` if you're using weird connectors. 

```sudo reboot``` after the update and upgrade are done. 

## When first upgrade is done

Now we can take care of graphics: 
For intel it is most of time already integrated... As it's a often used in "dual" graphics 

```sudo apt install {nvidia-driver-XXX}```

For AMD it's a bit more fun: They are included in the Linux kernel due to their open-source. 
But you will need some tools for modern applications:

```sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers mesa-utils``` 

> **_NOTE:_** It's best to go find on the official sites for compatibility:
> Device manufacturer (This gives you the full specs)
> Graphics provider (Specific version compatible with^^)

You will need to reboot again, then ```nvidia-smi``` to check or the mesa/vulkan equivalent.

## Keeping an install clean

Keep only essential packages, this both helps your system and makes you less vulnerable:

List all packages: It might seem like there is a lot of fluff depending on distro but if you're on a fresh install it's quite normal as it's all the system components.
This number is still 2-3x lower than a Windows counterpart.

```dpkg -l```

Check an individual problematic package: 

```dpkg -l | grep {package_name}```

Useful to check past pkg installs

```grep "install " /var/log/dpkg.log | tail```

## Update warnings ⚠️
These can happen quite frequently when one of the software providers you use didn't update to latest signatures. 
This will give you annoying errors

Here is how to fix it:

Removing
```sudo apt remove --purge {pkgs1} {pkgs2}```

To make sure dependencies are also removed
```sudo apt autoremove --purge```

----

Check the problematic package:

```grep -r "brave" /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/```

Remove it from sources list:

```sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list```

Then run update to your packages lists again to remove the warning:
```sudo apt update```

If you 're still having issues with dependencies USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:

```sudo apt full-upgrade```

## Security 🔒

```sudo apt install ufw```
```sudo ufw enable```
```sudo ufw allow ssh``` Make sure to use keys :)

This will restrict incoming traffic, you can use a VPN for further anonimity. 

If you're running local servers: 
```sudo ufw allow 80/tcp``` 

To secure that further you can look into reverse proxies. 

## 🖥️ Remote desktop sessions

For some weird reason this can be quite annoying depending on the distro
> **_NOTE:_** One thing  I found to fix a lot of my issues is to create a second user with elevated privileges so that you can remote connect to it easily while keeping the device functional on it's own. 

```sudo apt install xrdp xserver-xorg-core```

```sudo systemctl enable xrdp```
```sudo systemctl start xrdp```

Check if it's running:

```sudo systemctl status xrdp```

```sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert```

If not rebooting sometimes helps. 

----

If you have ufw enable make sure to ```sudo ufw allow 3389```
This is the standard port.

If you get a black screen you might need to ```echo "gnome-session" > ~/.xsession```
Depending on your desktop type. 

```ip addr show```

Then add the specific port 3389

It should look something like: 192.x.x.x:3390 and you DO NOT NEED to specify a user just yet.
Now this is where it usually fails because you're already in the session. To me the best is to make a second user for remote sessions:

```sudo adduser {rdpuser}```

Then give it privileges: ```sudo usermod -aG sudo {rdpuser}```

There you go :) You know how to make a good install. For cherry on the cake you can share a folder between all users (this could be your coding or media?)

```chmod 777 {/home/mainuser/shared-folder}```

Then you can login into this new user you created without breaking everything!

## Screen tear 📺
If you cannot find a solution you can try disabling gpu acceleration for a specific program when launching it: 
```{code} --disable-gpu```


## Packages
Flatpack is the most practical way to download apps in my opinion: They will be slightly heavier than on Windows because:
Many modern apps (like Stremio) are built using Electron, which bundles a full Chromium engine and Node.js runtime. This increases the size of the app significantly.

.deb packages will also work! dpkg is designed to work with these files. 
They will be lighter because they interact directly with the host system. 

But they install seemlessly with dependencies: 

```flatpak list
flatpak install 
flatpak uninstall 
flatpak uninstall --unused
flatpak remove --unused
```

Some distros like Linux Mint have a neat little software manager pre-installed!

## Developer tools

I personally just get vs code from the official source and is nicely integrated with Python with the public Microsoft extensions.
The beauty of it is that a large part of linux itself uses python compatible libraries as it's
